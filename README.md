# ZSDK

ZSDK is a project aimed to be a beginner friendly GZDoom based mod builder. It is not mean to be a replacement or competitor to Slade (Maybe even GZDoom Builder in the future) but act as a stepping stone in the future.

ZSDK is built in Haxe for easy cross platform deployment, though I don't recommend any platforms besides native. Haxelibs used are Lime, openFL, and Haxeui.

Progress:

Base UI: You can make a new project and it makes the folders :D

PK3 Export: Can actually package files into a PK3!

Lumps:

-Mapinfo
- Cluster defs:
	- Keywords (DONE)
	- Compile (DONE)
	- UI (NYI)

- Episode defs:
	- Keywords (DONE)
	- Compile (DONE)
	- UI (NYI)

Anyone willing to contribute to this project, once I have all the groundwork ready so everyone can see how I want it to flow, are more than welcome to join and I'm willing to help set up Haxe for them if they are new to the toolkit.
