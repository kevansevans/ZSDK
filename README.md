# ZSDK: The unofficial GZDoom Source Development kit
***

ZSDK is a development kit aimed to provide a base foundation for total conversion mods meant to be played using the GZDoom engine. The goal is to provide assets and tools that are comprehensive and easy to use at any skill level.
***
### ZSDK.pk3

ZSDK.pk3 is the core package and minimum needed set to utilize ZSDK. Contained are a multitude of assets, actors, scripts, binds, etcetra for anyone to use. The license is MIT, so you can include it with your mod if it needs to rely on the provided lumps. Advanced users can also use it as quick reference and exclude it from deployment if needed.

Included in this set are config files for GZDoom builder, which must be added into \GZDoom Builder\Configurations
***
### ZSDK IDE
ZSDK IDE is the editor used as a begginer friendly approach to building a GZDoom mod. In no way is this meant to act as a replacement or competitor to Slade.
